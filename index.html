        About My GOAT, Arsi Hakita Patala!
    </h1>

    <p>
        Hello, my name is Jack Mossberg. And I would like to introduce to you my 'GOAT' (.Greatest .Of .All .Time)
        Arsi Hakita Patala or otherwise known as 'Hakita'. Online Hakita is known the mind behind the hit game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/">Ultrakill</a> 
        and it's one of a kind sound-track.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I have many reasons for nominating Hakita Arsi as my GOAT. My biggest reason would have to be his seemingly unwaivering resolve
        when it comes to the subject of game development and/or music composition. Primarily when it comes to create the best possible product, even under
        the insane pressure to deliver on his dream game Ultrakill.
    </p>
    <p style="color: red;">
        The Following is some more info about my GOAT, Hakita. Enjoy!
    </p>
